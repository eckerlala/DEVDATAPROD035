#Study of Behaviour of a Linear Model

This repository contains all files which are necessary for the "Course Project" of the Coursera Course "Developing Data Products".

You will find in the folder **R** following files

- server.R
- ui.R

The shiny application can be run on RStudio's shiny server (see link in the submission page).

The presentation is done in RStudios Presenter. 
The necessary files therefore you will find in folder **Presentation**.
The presentation itself can be found in RPubs (see link in the submission page).

I hope the user interface is self-describing. So no additional documentation will be needed.

***Have Fun and enjoy!***
